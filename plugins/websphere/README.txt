Fediz configuration in IBM Websphere
------------------------------------

The Websphere installation must be updated before a Web Application can be deployed.

Note: Due to dependencies to IBM licensed libraries this module is not built by default.
Instead, Maven profiles are provided to build the Websphere plugin.

The following wiki page gives instructions how to do that:

The following wiki page explains the fediz configuration which is Container independent:
